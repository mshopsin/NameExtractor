Many of you may be planning to travel during the Thanksgiving holiday or during the break between Fall and Winter Terms.

PLEASE REMEMBER: If you are planning to leave and re-enter the United States (even if you are only travelling as far as Canada), please check your I-20. You may need a travel signature.

You must have a *hand-written* signature from an International Center Designated School Official on page 3 of your I-20, and that signature must be no more than one year old WHEN YOU RE-ENTER THE UNITED STATES.

Please plan ahead -- travel signatures take 5 working days to process.

Also, the International Center will be CLOSED from noon on Wednesday, November 23, 2011, through 8 a.m. Monday, November 28, 2011, and from 5 p.m. on Friday, December 23, 2011, through 8 a.m. Tuesday, January 3, 2012.

If you need a travel signature:

1). Please fill out and print the I-20 Travel Signature Drop-off Form http://internationalcenter.umich.edu/immig/forms/I-20sigdropoff.pdf

2). Hand the form in at the reception desk of the Central Campus International Center.  Please be sure to include all attachments listed in the instructions at the top of the form.

3). Even if you have left and re-entered the United States many times, please review "Travel Outside the U.S. and Re-entry" http://www.internationalcenter.umich.edu/immig/fvisa/fj_traveladvis.html to be aware of any recent changes.
