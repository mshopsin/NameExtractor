Interested in designing and building a footbridge, and possibly traveling to the Dogon region of Maliin Spring/Summer 2012? 
Join Bridges to Prosperity (B2P)! B2P is the brand new U-M Chapter of the nonprofit Bridges to Prosperity, whose mission is to "provide isolated communities with access to essential healthcare, education and economic opportunities by building footbridges over impassable rivers". B2P is searching for students interested in structural design, surveying, construction, and especially those who are fluent or nearing fluency in French!
U-M researchers in anthropology and biochemistry have been working with villages in the Dogon region for decades. A village in the rocky District of Sangha has identified as their top priority a footbridge to reach their fields and the market, which are across a gorge from the village. The gorge is a great challenge, and currently there is a temporary causeway that floods in heavy rains. Farmers are unable to tend to their fields when strong rains gush into the gorge, and women often stumble and lose their baskets of vegetables that they have carried on their heads for up to ten miles.
Interested and want to know more? Come to the B2P Mass Meeting on Monday, November 28th at 6 PM in CSE 1670. There are many, many opportunities forundergraduate and graduate students as B2P is just starting; opportunities includeleadership positions, independent study credits, fellowship and grant opportunities, and paths in the Multidisciplinary Design Program.

Don't hesitate to contact Professor Ann Jeffers (jffrs@umich.edu) or Julie Bateman (jbate@umich.edu) with any questions and concerns.
