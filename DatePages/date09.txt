SPEAKER:  Tayfun Özdemir, Ph.D.  President, Virtual EM, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI   

TITLE:  	   "Disruptive Technology Development in the areas of Wireless Sensors"



Abstract: Bio/Chemical sensing has immense potential to improve human life by making it possible to detect explosives, ensure food safety, and monitor environment, to name a few. Merging wireless technology with sensing makes the system more effective in terms of detection range, ease of deployment and system management. This talk will present high-risk/high-return technology development efforts at Virtual EM with particular emphasis on detecting Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).
