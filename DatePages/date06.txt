Dear Faculty, Staff, and Students,
 
Prof. J. Gary Eden from the University of Illinois will present the MIPSE Seminar “Microcavity Plasma Science and Recent Applications: Bound-Free Coupling, Transistors and Illumination” on Wednesday, October 26, 4:00 pm in 1005 EECS.  Gary is (without question!) one of the world’s leading researchers in the science and technology of microplasmas, having pioneered the scaling of these devices from single apertures to large arrays of millions of apertures, from lifetimes to minutes to lifetimes of years. In addition to Gary’s work on microplasmas, he has made immense impact in electric discharge, beam and optically pumped lasers, spectroscopy of rare-gas, metal-halide and halogen dimers, laser activated chemical vapor deposition and fs spectroscopy. In addition to all that, he is a multi-company entrepreneur.
Please see the abstract on the MIPSE website:

I hope to see you at the seminar.
 
Mark
