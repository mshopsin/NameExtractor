Al and Laurie went from friends to lovers,  an insider tells Star.  It couldnâ€™t be avoided.  Pick up the new issue of Star tomorrow for our complete story of how the pair, who have been fighting for the environment for years and worked together on Al's 2006 Oscar-winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth, fell hard for one another â€” and if Tipper had any clue.
