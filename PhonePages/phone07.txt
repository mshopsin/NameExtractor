OS 10.5.8 installed.

Ram can be upgraded to 2GB for $40 (for example at macsales.com).

I am selling a Kensington Contour Pro 15" Laptop bag with it (or separately) for $40 (new price $90). It's in excellent condition - see pic below.

I live in Vallejo, but can meet you in surrounding towns if you're serious.

please call 707-704-6901 (DO NOT TEXT this number); for text messages use: 707-371-6972; or reply via email. 

If this listing is still up, I still have the item.
